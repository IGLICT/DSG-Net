# DSM-Net: Disentangled Structured Mesh Net for Controllable Generation of Fine Geometry

![Overview](https://github.com/daerduoCarey/structurenet/blob/master/images/teaser.png)

**Figure 1.** StructureNet is a hierarchical graph network that produces a unified latent space to encode structured models with both continuous geometric and discrete structural variations. In this example, we projected an un-annotated point cloud (left) and un-annotated image (right) into the learned latent space yielding semantically segmented point clouds structured as a hierarchy of graphs. The shape interpolation in the latent space also produces structured point clouds (top) including their corresponding graphs (bottom). Edges correspond to specific part relationships that are modeled by our approach. For simplicity, here we only show the graphs without the hierarchy. Note how the base of the chair morphs via functionally plausible intermediate configurations, or the chair back transitions from a plain back to a back with arm-rests.

## Introduction
We introduce a hierarchical graph network for learning structure-aware shape generation which (i) can directly encode shape parts represented as such n-ary graphs; (ii) can be robustly trained on large and complex shape families such as PartNet; and (iii) can be used to generate a great diversity of realistic structured shape geometries with both both continuous geometric and discrete structural variations.
